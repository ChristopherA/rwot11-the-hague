The Verifiable Credential ecosystem has encountered several use cases that require a third-party assertion, or an endorsement of an existing object (another VC, a PDF, a webpage, etc). Whether it is product reviews, endorsements of self-created credentials, academic paper reviews, or some other general purpose third party assertion, these use cases have several requirements in common.  Each use case may also require a domain-specific set of fields.

We propose a minimal format for Linked Claims that will allow each use case of 3rd party assertions to be represented as a set of LinkedClaims.

Further, we propose to demonstrate the ability to compose several LinkedClaims into a single domain-specific credential, specifically a Verifiable Endorsement, that will satisfy the domain requirements of the likely users.

This approach will enable rich shared datasets to inform trust decisions, while satisfying the requirements of domain-specific end users.  If time permits a sample score can be built over the linked claim dataset.
