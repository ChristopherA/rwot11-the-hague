# RWOT11 Credential Profile Comparison

<!-- Task: Create an abstract
* A self-contained text, not an exceprt from the paper
* Be fully understandable on its own
* Reflect the structure of your larger work -->

<!-- ## Artifact: The targeted outcome.  -->
The artifact created is a *comparison matrix* for **credential profiles** and an *application guideline* for using the matrix to conduct own assessments of such profiles. The RWOT11 session continues the work kicked off in an IIWXXIV session in April 2022 and worked on offline afterwards. It is a second iteration of the overview of credentials, with validated attributes and categories and further content added. A discussion of the different credential profiles will follow later and is not subject of the work at RWOT11. 

<!-- ## Purpose: The reason for this artifact. -->
The work result is important because it allows a fact-based, more objective discussion of different credential profiles. There are multiple specifications of credentials out there with their strengths and disadvantages. Depending on the use case there are different demands and the comparison matrix can help to make the right credential profile decision.<!-- ## Audience & Impact: Beneficiaries of the work. --> It supplies an assessment tool to help innovators, industry, developers, security researchers, and in general people that want to use credentials in their use cases:
1. Explore and understand the technical landscape
2. Explore technical opportunities and challenges
3. Make technical and use case design choices
