## COVID Policy

We are risking our health and the health of our loved ones by traveling to this event, but we also don't want to damage our work products.

There is more risk because we have people traveling from around the world in previously isolated domains. But the airports were probably the biggest risk.

So the **daily testing** is the most important thing.

* **Everyone please mask in plenaries.**
* More of a choice in small groups.
* Talk to Ombudspeople if you have concerns about groups.
* Think about risk getting worse over the course of the week.

For COVID Testing:
* Please do it everyday
* There is a 1 in 6 false negative: if you are symptomic and test negative, please test again!
* There is a 1 in 500 false positive: if you are asymptomic and test positive, please test again!

## Welcome!

The goal is to move from individual thinking to collective thinking.
* Hearing other peoples' ideas
* And taking them in.

Be as you are.
* As you full self, not just professional self.

Suspend judgement, listen deeply.
* Be curious!

Lean into incompleteness.

Contribute with heart AND make space for everyone to do the same.

Take care of yourself & your team.
