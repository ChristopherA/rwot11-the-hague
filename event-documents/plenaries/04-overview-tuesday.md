# Overviews of Abstracts from Day 1

## Credential Profile Comparison

Creating a comparison matrix for credential profiles. Continuing on from previous work, and continuing in the future: reviewing old work and advancing work.

## Trusted Issuer / Trusted Verifier Lists

Helping a party to decide whether to work with a counterparty. Paying attention to prior art and expanding.

## Trust

Trust is not well understood and it's used in different context to mean different things; hoping that a model will help people understand what trust is.

## Defining Rendering Methods for VC

Need consistent & interoperable rendering methods in VCs. Surveying and then suggesting interoperable methods.

## Specification for OmniThreats in a Ledger-Agnostic Ways

Decouple omnithreats from a specific ledger.

## Verifiable Endorsement Proposal

## Identity Attack Threat Analysis

List & possibly describe attacks on DID Methods and other decentralized solutions.

## On-Chain Verification

Analyze different on-chain verification methods. 

## Accessible Data Exchange Ecosystem

Allowing for human-based data exchange: interoperable while keeping people in control of their data.

## Is this method ready for a standard?

Allowing implementers to choose appropriate DID methods for their purposes. Important is whether a DID method is sufficiently well standardized.

## DIDcomm Group Chat

Envision a group of up to 1000 people who may not trust other. The challenge of a decentralized solution is parallel message history.

## DID:Merkle

Issue the same VC to all members of a group, without identifying who is in the group.

## Data Minimization

Also, anti-correlation techniques in data minimization. Using as foundation data minimization paper from several RWOTs ago.

## VC Data Model

Current model doesn't allow a verifier to verify that a credential was presented by the intended holder.
