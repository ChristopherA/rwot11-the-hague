# Collective Mapping

We had three rounds of discussion about insights into our topics. The last of the rounds included objects that inspired us.

Here were some of the insights:

* Governance is difficult. Different people approach it in different ways.
* There was a layer to incentive to find more layers than just binary. 
* Incentive to gather and contribute is something that needs to be considered.
* Identity should be fun, inclusive.
* Big companies are getting into field. 
* Lack of incentive for people to work for good in open source instead of those big companies!
* Need policies from gov't to support open source.
* Scale is both our goal and our problem. We want mass adoption, but are afraid of power imbalance.
* Communities of context can help value & accountability.
* We need to be accountable to our communities!
* SSI systems are too complex to achieve headline goals (adoption, trust, whatever).
* It makes it hard to get the one little bit that any individual is interested in.
* We need to find ways into system: reduce before we get to the whole story.
* A lot of energy at our tables. People want to channel it for cooperation!
* Worried about relation of what we're doing to reality. What are the actual problems we're solving out there in the world?
* Is there an inherent tradeoff between competitive innovation and adherance to commons and interoperability.
* There's a difference between compromise and ideal that everyone can verify every credential.
* Not good feedback between practical implementation and theory of SSI.
* We're focusing on a small aspect of humanity (people who have phones, internet).
* As an industry, we're selling fear, and that's never completely exciting.
* We need to help people be safe and help when there's a problem, not just tell people not to do unsafe things.
* Interoperability is also about *us*.
* There are non-human perspectives.
* We are not a representative group for the planet. (We are WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, And Democratic).
* We need to talk about group identity, not just individual identity.
