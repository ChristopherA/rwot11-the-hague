## Aha's & Tips

An overview of aha's and tip's

* Tip: Many central shops are open later on Thursday.
* Appreciation: A great new term, "selective correlation", for when you want something correlated.
* We need to think about symmetry when two parties are working together: wallets should not just be holder wallets, but also issue and verify!
* New EU regulations! EU are being required to issue wallets to citizens free of charge! Some are becoming official! Verifiers are obliged to use them!
* Anoncreds, VCs, could use some unification, would allow for more crypto-agility
* We are doing great things, but they also have flaws: so we should try to win narrative, not focus on mechanisms
* Surprising how narrowly scoped this RWOT is. Topic papers all pretty far down in the weeds.
* But there's also a use for doing a small things that's doable.
* Think about a small little 5-minute use-case/user-study section
