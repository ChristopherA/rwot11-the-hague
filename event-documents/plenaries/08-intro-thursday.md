# Thursday Afternoon Start

## Aha's & Tips

* Everyone is struggling; which is nice. Because sometimes you feel you're the only one who is struggling! (Dinners help us understand this jointly!)
* New AIs can create marvelous voice and image creations. We need to think about the consequences of ubiquitous creation of images and sounds (for security, for QRs, etc).
* To solve things you need to narrow your focus.
* We also have issues with terminology (but that's another place where discussions help).
* In smaller discussions we've seen broader discussions, even if they're not appearing in plenaries.
* What does "control" really mean in our context?
* The terminology of "control" may actually be problematic!
* An exercise yesterday also showed how everyone had different criteria for what a "holder" was!
* We need to work through our different terminologies!
