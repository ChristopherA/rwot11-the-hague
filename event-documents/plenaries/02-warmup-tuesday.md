Among the revelations:

* People were excited about meeting each other in person.
* A deep acceptance of hearing what people want to say.
* Duality: excitement & worry.
* Excitement about getting together with people physically.
* Social impact!
* Trust is not binary
* SSI space is getting more and more diverse.
