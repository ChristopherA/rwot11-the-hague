* WoT is expensive in terms of time and commitment, but it doesn't feel adversarial, which is appreciated.
* Enjoy learning that our individual problems are common problems, and then we can all take home something that is valuable.
* Balance in structured & unstructured work worked well.
* Enjoying learning about what's going on new in the field; have a sense of community & what we're doing.
* Have a sense of progress, after COVID took us out of this rhythm. 
* Community, progress, and empathy. Feel at home here with everyone. Feel safe because there's a lot common, shared context.
* General sense of excitement!
* Feeling that people here not because they _have_ to be here, but because they _want_ to be here.
* Love that there are experts with years in field and with hours in the field, and they're all treated with respect.
* Have enjoyed generosity and accomodation from people, making space accessible for everyone! Open-mindedness.
