# Final Thoughts

## What Has Worked Well?

* WoT is expensive in terms of time and commitment, but it doesn't feel adversarial, which is appreciated.
* Enjoy learning that our individual problems are common problems, and then we can all take home something that is valuable.
* Balance in structured & unstructured work worked well.
* Enjoying learning about what's going on new in the field; have a sense of community & what we're doing.
* Have a sense of progress, after COVID took us out of this rhythm. 
* Community, progress, and empathy. Feel at home here with everyone. Feel safe because there's a lot common, shared context.
* General sense of excitement!
* Feeling that people here not because they _have_ to be here, but because they _want_ to be here.
* Love that there are experts with years in field and with hours in the field, and they're all treated with respect.
* Have enjoyed generosity and accomodation from people, making space accessible for everyone! Open-mindedness.

## Trickier Moments & Suggestions for Future

* Can go much more in-depth on topics, but maybe it would be nice if there was more ability to jump between papers.
* Might be nice to have more focus on threshold of contributor, author, and just "chaos monkey".
* Sometimes spend too much time on semantic discussions; next time do use groups of 3 to do exercise for terminology.
* The brief exercises of a few moments left some people done too early, some done too late. We need to be more diligent with timing as participants.
* Would like more opportunities before the event, such as office hours this time. Just need to communicate them better.
* Appreciated time we could do things during unstructured time without disrupting structure times.
* It would be nice to have interns from different countries to create a powerful connection. To generally bring in people who are neither business nor tech. Grad students too, researchers.
* Could use some quiet space.
* Don't use the word "technical" because it can be exclusionary.
* Could use more careful speaking for non-English speakers. Could do an exercise to help people accomodate the fact that we are an international community.
* Poster session needed numbering of posters.
* Want to be able to argue about using DIDs from a practicality reason. 
* Helping to structure discussions could be useful when working in groups.
* Missed not having white boards.
* We need help in puzzling out what the actual space requirements are.
