# Rebooting the Web of Trust XI: The Hague (September 2022)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT11, the eleventh Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will be held in the Hague, Netherlands, September, 2022

The goal of the workshop is to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the  greatest impact on the future.

## Final Papers

## [*Taking out the CRUD: Five Fabulous DID Attacks*](final-documents/taking-out-the-crud-five-fabulous-did-attacks.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/taking-out-the-crud-five-fabulous-did-attacks.md)
#### by Shannon Appelcline, Cihan Saglam, Kate Sills, Carsten Stöcker

> Decentralized identity solutions, such as DID methods, tend to be designed to protect against certain attacks, but the purpose of that design usually is not explicitly stated in any architectural description or threat documentation. In particular, some DID methods have costly on-chain requirements that must have had a reasoning behind their requirement. We can today see that these DID methods were purposefully shaped, but it’s not clear why such decisions were made. The purpose of this paper is to describe a few colorful attacks on DID methods so that we can better understand what threats a system might be vulnerable to.

> Although we derived the examples in this paper by examining current DID methods, we believe these attack vectors are more general, even for systems not using DIDs. The goal is to support engineers and developers who are developing decentralized identity solutions to safeguard their work and make it secure and compliant.

## Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants are invited to contribute a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

   * A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
   * A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings directory](./advance-readings/advance-reading-primer.md) for all the current papers (and how to upload yours). Advance readings from RWOT10 (cancelled due to COVID) are also included.
