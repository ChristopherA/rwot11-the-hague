# Rebooting the Web of Trust XI (Fall 2022) Final Papers

_This is a listing for the RWOT9 papers to date. [Several more](../draft-documents/README.md) are in process._

## [*Linking Credentials with Data Exchange Agreements through Secured Inclusive Interfaces*](data-exchange-agreements-with-oca.pdf) [(Text)](data-exchange-agreements-with-oca.md)

#### by  Lal Chandran, Lotta Lundin, Fredrik Lindén,  Philippe Page,  Paul Knowles,  Víctor Martínez Jurado,  Andrew Slack

> On the need to link verifiable credentials with the right to use data in a secure, inclusive user interaction.

> In this collaborative work from RWOT11, we revisit the issue of patient data exchange in a setting requiring cross-border, multi jurisdiction, and inclusive access to all participants. A fundamental problem in developing large-scale real-world solutions based on verifiable credentials is keeping the simplicity of usage for individuals in different contexts without sacrificing security.

> We aim to highlight selected technical challenges and outline how the DEXA and OCA protocols contribute to scalable solutions.

## [*Taking out the CRUD: Five Fabulous DID Attacks*](taking-out-the-crud-five-fabulous-did-attacks.pdf) [(Text)](taking-out-the-crud-five-fabulous-did-attacks.md)
#### by Shannon Appelcline, Cihan Saglam, Kate Sills, Carsten Stöcker

> Decentralized identity solutions, such as DID methods, tend to be designed to protect against certain attacks, but the purpose of that design usually is not explicitly stated in any architectural description or threat documentation. In particular, some DID methods have costly on-chain requirements that must have had a reasoning behind their requirement. We can today see that these DID methods were purposefully shaped, but it’s not clear why such decisions were made. The purpose of this paper is to describe a few colorful attacks on DID methods so that we can better understand what threats a system might be vulnerable to.

> Although we derived the examples in this paper by examining current DID methods, we believe these attack vectors are more general, even for systems not using DIDs. The goal is to support engineers and developers who are developing decentralized identity solutions to safeguard their work and make it secure and compliant.
